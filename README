=== BUILDING ===

Before building You should checkout, build lib-myshows

uses lib-myshows v0.1).

to build executable .jar and documentation, placed in "msh-shell-$version".
"msh-shell-$version" directory also contains all necessary libraries required
to work properly.

Current implementation of shell(in case you have only .jar file) may be found
in .jar file "META_INF/MANIFEST.MF".
Version info also included into 'Shell.java' represented as auto-generated
variable updated on every 'ant compile' run.
